# transformer_forecast_pipeline.py

"""
High-level script to implement a Transformer model that replaces Elastic Net for
forecasting HR values from ensemble forecasts using a rolling window approach.

This mirrors the Elastic Net pipeline with these phases:
1. Prepare supervised training samples
2. Build a Transformer model (encoder-only)
3. Train the model on historical data
4. Predict next day's HR values for each forecast date
5. Output results for evaluation

# === Data Preparation ===

    Create X and Y datasets:
    - X: 3960xN (165-day rolling window with features)
    - Y: 96 (target HR values for next day)

    Uses same windowing as Elastic Net setup, but assembles full training set
    instead of looping one forecast at a time.

    Should return:
    - X: np.array, shape [num_samples, 3960, n_features]
    - Y: np.array, shape [num_samples, 96]
    - forecast_dates: list of timestamps (used in testing later)
